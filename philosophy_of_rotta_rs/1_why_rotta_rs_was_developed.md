# Why ROTTA-rs Was Developed

`ROTTA-rs` was developed as an open-source deep learning library with the primary goal of providing an <u>easy-to-use</u>, <u>lightweight</u>, and <u>flexible</u> tool, especially for developers and researchers looking to understand and rebuild the fundamentals of machine learning from the ground up.

Starting from concerns about the complexity and heavy load of existing deep learning libraries, `ROTTA-rs` presents itself as a minimalist yet modular alternative. This library supports not only forward pass but also automatic backpropagation through an autodiff mechanism integrated throughout its functionality.

ROTTA-rs is also written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a language known for its safety, execution speed, and low-level control over memory. The choice of Rust as a foundation is not only a technical choice, but also a reflection of the developer's philosophy: building efficient AI systems.

ROTTA-rs is far from perfect, and therefore, bugs may occur. Therefore, I welcome all suggestions and criticism for the future development of ROTTA-rs.
